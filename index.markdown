# InsectACIDE: Debugger-Based Holistic Asynchronous CFI for Embedded System

  

InsectACIDE is the first kernel-level CFI for embedded and real-time systems that does not require binary instrumentation and is real-time friendly.

  

The results of this project were published in the paper entitled "[InsectACIDE: Debugger-Based Holistic Asynchronous CFI for Embedded System]" in the IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS) 2024.
